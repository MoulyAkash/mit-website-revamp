        <div className="about-content">
          With the dawn of Independence, the need for establishing a sound
          technological basis for proper industrial advancement of the country
          was realised. Towards the fulfilment of this need, a number of
          Engineering Institutions were established by several State
          Governments. It was at this juncture that Mr.C.Rajam, with his
          characteristic pioneering spirit, patriotic fervor and unwavering
          enthusiasm came up with a munificent donation of Rs. 5 lakhs through
          the sale of his house and founded the MIT, with the blessings of the
          Sage of Kanchi, the Jagadguru Sankaracharya Swamigal. In this noble
          effort, Mr.Rajam enjoyed the inspired assistance of a few
          distinguished citizens, notably Subbaraya Aiyar, M.K. Ranganathan,
          L.Venkatakrishna Iyer, K.Srinivasan and C.R. Srinivasan and also
          generous donations from the public and industries. Thus in July 1949,
          the MIT was established as an All India Technological Institution with
          the two-fold objectives of providing

          At a time when all other Engineering Institutions were offering
          conventional courses in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering
          at the Under-graduate level, it was the rare innovation and foresight
          of Mr. Rajam that impelled him in the eve of his life to launch on a
          bold experiment of introducing for the first time in our country,
          totally new areas of specialisation in Engineering, viz. Aeronautical
          Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Electronics Engineering and
          Instrumentation Technology, the entrants to these disciplines being
          Science graduates. This was a pioneering step in engineering education
          in India. How wise and foreseeing this selection was, is shown by the
          striking growth that India has made in road transport and in the
          manufacture of road vehicles of all types; in the progress of civil
          and military aviation and the manufacture of military aircraft; and in
          the enormous growth in the applications of electronics and the
          electronics manufacturing industry. Instrumentation and Control which
          form the bedrock of industry did not exist in India as a subject of
          study in 1949; even the name was still below the horizon. Now this
          branch of applied science and technology has become all important in
          every industry, small or big, light or heavy. How useful and relevant
          the trained manpower in these fields has been, is borne out by the
          fact that a significantly large number of the past students of MIT are
          now holding key positions in research and development organisations,
          manufacturing industries and educational institutions within the
          country and abroad. The broad-based curriculum at the MIT has indeed
          proved to be particularly advantageous with the ever-increasing need
          for engineers adequately equipped to handle a wide range of problems.

          The Institute owes its present stature to the unstinted efforts and
          dynamic leadership of its Founders, Chairmen and Members of the
          Governing Council, Directors, Staff and Alumni and also, in no small
          measure, to the quality and character of its students during the last
